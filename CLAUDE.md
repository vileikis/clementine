# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Clementine** is a digital AI photobooth platform that empowers brands, event creators, and marketers to create stunning, AI-enhanced photobooth experiences without physical booths or technical skills.

### What We're Building

A web-based platform where:

- **Experience Creators** (brands/event organizers) set up AI-powered photo experiences with custom prompts and branding
- **Guests** visit a shareable link, upload a photo, and receive an AI-transformed result in under 1 minute
- **Analytics** help creators measure engagement, shares, and campaign success

See [product.md](.specify/memory/product.md) for full product strategy, user flows, MVP scope, and success metrics.

### Spec-Driven Development

This project follows **spec-driven development** practices. Key documentation like technical standards, conventions, and coding guidelines in `standards/`

**IMPORTANT**: Before implementing any feature or making changes, you MUST:

1. Read `standards/README.md` to understand applicable standards
2. Review relevant standards from `standards/` based on your task:
   - `global/` - Always applicable (coding style, conventions, validation, error handling)
   - `frontend/` - For UI/UX work (CSS, components, accessibility, responsive design)
   - `backend/` - For API/data work (Firebase, API routes, models)
   - `testing/` - For test implementation
3. Follow all standards strictly in your implementation

### Technical Stack

This is a pnpm monorepo with two workspaces:

- **`web/`** - Next.js 16 app (React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui) - mobile-first guest experience and creator dashboard
- **`functions/`** - Firebase Cloud Functions (placeholder for future n8n/webhook integration for AI generation workflows)

## Commands

Run all commands from the **root directory**:

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start Next.js dev server (port 3000)

# Building & Running
pnpm build            # Build production web app
pnpm start            # Start production server

# Code Quality
pnpm lint             # Run ESLint on web app
pnpm type-check       # TypeScript type checking (web app only)
```

### Working in the web workspace

```bash
cd web
pnpm dev              # Local dev server
pnpm build            # Production build
pnpm lint             # Lint only
pnpm type-check       # TypeScript check without emit
```

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

This is a **pnpm workspace** monorepo (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`). Root `package.json` scripts use `pnpm --filter web` to target the web workspace.

### Web Application (Next.js 16)

- **App Router**: Uses the Next.js App Router (`src/app/`)
- **TypeScript**: Strict TypeScript configuration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS variables for theming
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui configured with:
  - Style: `new-york`
  - Base color: `neutral`
  - Import aliases: `@/components`, `@/lib`, `@/hooks`, etc.
  - Components location: `src/components/ui/`
  - Utilities: `src/lib/utils.ts`

### Import Aliases

The web app uses path aliases (configured in `tsconfig.json`):

- `@/*` maps to `src/*`
- shadcn/ui components use `@/components/ui`
- Utilities use `@/lib/utils`

### Adding shadcn/ui Components

```bash
cd web
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

Components are added to `src/components/ui/` and can be imported via `@/components/ui/<component-name>`.

### Backend Architecture (Planned)

The `functions/` workspace is a placeholder for Firebase Cloud Functions that will handle:

- **n8n workflow integration** - AI image generation pipeline (Nano Banana, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
- **Event & asset storage** - Firebase/Firestore for event configurations and generated images
- **Webhook processing** - Communication between web app and AI generation services

## Product Architecture

### Feature Modules & Data Model

The application is organized into feature modules in `web/src/features/`. The data model has been redesigned to use a **normalized Firestore architecture** with flat root collections (see `features/data-model-v4.md` for full specification).

**IMPORTANT: Legacy Code**

- Legacy implementations have been moved to `web/src/legacy-features/`
- **Do NOT reference or use legacy code unless explicitly asked**
- Only consult legacy features when specifically mentioned by the user (e.g., "check legacy-features for reference")
- When creating new feature modules from scratch, legacy code may be referenced if explicitly requested

#### Feature Module Status

**✅ Ready - Companies** (`web/src/features/companies/`)

- **Firestore Collection**: `/companies/{companyId}`
- **Purpose**: Brand/organization management that owns events
- **Status**: Fully implemented and stable
- **Schema**: name, status, brandColor, contactEmail, termsUrl, privacyUrl
- **Features**: Soft deletion (status: "active" | "deleted"), event count tracking

**✅ Ready - Events** (`web/src/features/events/`)

- **Firestore Collection**: `/events/{eventId}`
- **Purpose**: Root container for event configuration and the real-time "Switchboard" state
- **Status**: Fully implemented with new data-model-v4 architecture
- **Schema**: name, status (draft/live/archived), ownerId, joinPath, qrPngPath, publishStartAt/EndAt, activeJourneyId, theme (nested object with logo, colors, text, button, background settings)
- **Features**: Switchboard pattern via `activeJourneyId`, comprehensive theming system

**✅ Ready - Experiences** (`web/src/features/experiences/`)

- **Firestore Collection**: `/experiences/{experienceId}`
- **Purpose**: Reusable library of atomic AI experience configurations
- **Status**: Fully implemented with new data-model-v4 architecture
- **Schema**: Discriminated union by type (photo/video/gif), companyId, eventIds (many-to-many), name, enabled, previewMediaUrl/previewType, captureConfig (type-specific), aiPhotoConfig/aiVideoConfig
- **Features**: Photo/Video/GIF experience types, capture settings (countdown, cameraFacing, overlays), AI transform settings (model, prompt, referenceImages, aspectRatio)

**✅ Ready - Journeys** (`web/src/features/journeys/`)

- **Firestore Collection**: `/events/{eventId}/journeys/{journeyId}` (subcollection of Event)
- **Purpose**: Define linear sequences of steps (playlists) for guest experiences
- **Status**: Fully implemented - CRUD operations, list view, active toggle, detail page
- **Schema**: id, eventId, name, stepOrder[], tags[], status (active/deleted), deletedAt, createdAt, updatedAt
- **Features**: Soft deletion, switchboard integration via Event.activeJourneyId, empty state handling, mobile-first responsive design

**✅ Ready - Steps** (`web/src/features/steps/`)

- **Firestore Collection**: `/events/{eventId}/steps/{stepId}` (subcollection of Event)
- **Purpose**: Individual UI screen configurations for guest journeys
- **Status**: Fully implemented with Journey Editor (006-journey-editor)
- **Schema**: Discriminated union by type (11 types), base fields (id, eventId, journeyId, type, title, description, mediaUrl, ctaLabel, createdAt, updatedAt), plus type-specific config
- **Step Types**: info, experience-picker, capture, short_text, long_text, multiple_choice, yes_no, opinion_scale, email, processing, reward
- **Features**: 3-panel editor (step list, preview, config), drag-and-drop reordering, real-time preview with event theme, type-specific configuration forms, URL deep linking

**📋 Planned - Sessions** (`web/src/features/sessions/`)

- **Firestore Collection**: `/sessions/{sessionId}`
- **Purpose**: Transactional records of guest runs through Journeys
- **Status**: Not yet started - will be completely rewritten
- **New Model**: Stores guest progress, collected data (form inputs, media captures), and AI generation results

**📋 Planned - Guest** (`web/src/features/guest/`)

- **Purpose**: Guest-facing experience and UI components
- **Status**: Will be completely rewritten to work with new data model

### Architecture Principles (New Model)

**Normalized Firestore Design**

- No nested subcollections beyond one level
- All entities at root collection level
- Linked by `eventId` references
- Enables future SQL migration

**Dynamic Injection Pattern**

- Capture steps load Experience configs at runtime
- Selection steps set session variables
- Experiences define their own required inputs
- Promotes reusability and atomic design

**Real-time Switchboard**

- Event's `activeJourneyId` controls live experience
- All connected guests react to changes
- Host can switch Journeys dynamically

### User Experience Priorities

- **Mobile-first** - Primary experience is on mobile devices
- **Speed** - AI transformation in under 1 minute
- **Simplicity** - Minimal friction from link → upload → result → share
- **White-label** - Fully customizable branding per event
