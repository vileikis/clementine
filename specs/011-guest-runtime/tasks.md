# Tasks: Guest Experience Runtime Engine

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/011-guest-runtime/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/server-actions.md

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested - minimal testing per Constitution Principle IV.

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Per plan.md, this feature uses Next.js monorepo structure:
- **Source**: `web/src/`
- **Features**: `web/src/features/{feature}/`
- **App Routes**: `web/src/app/(public)/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 - BLOCKS all user stories
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: Depends on Phase 2 - core end-to-end flow
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: Depends on Phase 2 - can run parallel to US1
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: Depends on Phase 3 - extends error handling
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: Depends on Phase 2 - can run parallel to US1
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: Depends on all user stories

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Core flow - no other story dependencies
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Input collection - can be parallel with US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Error handling - builds on US1 components
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Experience picker - builds on US1 flow

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
```
All server actions can be developed in parallel by different developers
since they're independent functions in the same file
```

**Within Phase 3 (US1)**:
```
# These can run in parallel (different files):
Task: T023 GuestCaptureStep.tsx
Task: T026 GuestProcessingStep.tsx
Task: T030 GuestRewardStep.tsx
```

**Across User Stories**:
```
# After Phase 2, these can run in parallel:
Developer A: User Story 1 (Phase 3)
Developer B: User Story 2 (Phase 4)
Developer C: User Story 4 (Phase 6)
# User Story 3 (Phase 5) depends on US1 completion
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (schema extensions)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (all session actions)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (end-to-end journey)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (input collection)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test full journey on mobile
6. Deploy/demo if ready - this is the MVP

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test end-to-end → Deploy (captures working!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test inputs → Deploy (full data collection!)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test errors → Deploy (production-ready!)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test picker → Deploy (multi-experience!)

### Suggested MVP Scope

**MVP = User Story 1 + User Story 2**

This delivers:
- Complete guest journey end-to-end (join → capture → AI → result)
- All input types working with data persistence
- Core value proposition: guests complete journeys and get AI results

User Stories 3-4 add polish:
- Error recovery (US3) - important for production
- Experience selection (US4) - nice to have

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [USn] label maps task to specific user story
- Each user story is independently testable
- US1 + US2 together form the MVP
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate independently
