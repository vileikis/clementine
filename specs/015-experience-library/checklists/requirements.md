## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- The PRD provided clear scope boundaries (in-scope vs out-of-scope items)
- No data migration required - starting fresh with new `/experiences` collection
- Existing journeys feature module serves as code basis (refactor, not rewrite)
- All "Journey" to "Experience" terminology changes are captured in FR-011
