    API contract for managing events within projects.

    **NOTE**: This is for DOCUMENTATION ONLY. The actual implementation uses
    Firestore client SDK (not REST API). This contract describes the logical
    API surface in OpenAPI format for clarity and reference.

    **Authentication**: All endpoints require workspace admin authorization.
    Security is enforced via Firebase Firestore security rules.
