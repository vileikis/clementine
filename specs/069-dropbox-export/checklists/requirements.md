# Specification Quality Checklist: Dropbox Export Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. The requirements document provided extensive detail, enabling a complete spec without clarification markers.
- The spec deliberately excludes implementation details (no mention of Cloud Tasks, Firestore, Firebase, etc.) — those belong in the planning phase.
- 18 functional requirements cover connect, disconnect, export, permissions, logging, failure handling, and security.
- 5 user stories span the full lifecycle: connect, configure, export, disconnect, and error recovery.
