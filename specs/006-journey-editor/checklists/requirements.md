# Specification Quality Checklist: Journey Editor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification derived from comprehensive PRD that included detailed architecture and component examples
- PRD mentioned specific technologies (React, Firebase, dnd-kit, etc.) but spec was written technology-agnostically
- 7 user stories cover all major user flows from basic step creation to advanced configuration
- 11 step types fully specified with their configuration requirements
- Edge cases cover empty states, deletion scenarios, and error handling
- All items pass validation - ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
