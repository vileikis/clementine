/**
 * TEMPORARILY DISABLED - Tests need complete rewrite for V4 schema
 *
 * This file will be updated in Phase 6 after ThemeEditor component refactor is complete.

 * Changes needed:
 * - Remove `share` field from mock Event objects (deleted in V4)
 * - Update theme structure for nested V4 schema (text, button, background sub-objects)
 * - Test new useReducer state management pattern
 * - Test all 7 theme sections
